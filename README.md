# macOS-Style Developer Portfolio 💻🍎

A fully interactive **macOS-inspired developer portfolio** that behaves like a desktop operating system instead of a traditional website.

This project simulates a real Mac environment where users interact with **apps, windows, and a responsive dock**, creating a premium, native-like experience directly in the browser.
